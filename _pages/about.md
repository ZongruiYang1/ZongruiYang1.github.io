I am a final-year Ph.D. student in Mathematics at Columbia University, advised by [Professor Ivan Corwin](https://www.math.columbia.edu/~corwin/). I received my undergraduate degree from Peking University.

I will be on the job market for postdoctoral positions beginning in Fall 2026.

About Me
======

My research focuses on the Kardar–Parisi–Zhang (KPZ) universality class and integrable probability, with an interest in how boundaries influence the behavior of random systems.

See my [Publications](https://ZongruiYang1.github.io/publications/) and [Talks](https://ZongruiYang1.github.io/talks/).
