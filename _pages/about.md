I am a final-year Ph.D. student in Mathematics at Columbia University, where I am advised by [Professor Ivan Corwin](https://www.math.columbia.edu/~corwin/). I received my undergraduate degree from Peking University.

I will be on the job market for postdoctoral positions beginning in Fall 2026.

More about me
======

My research interests mainly lie in integrable probability and Kardar–Parisi–Zhang (KPZ) universality, with a particular focus on interacting particle systems, directed polymer models, six-vertex models and their stationary measures.

So far, my appeared works are about stationary measures for the open asymmetric simple exclusion process and for integrable polymer models and six-vertex models on a strip. See my [PUBLICATIONS LIST](https://ZongruiYang1.github.io/publications/).

For the talks I gave, see my [TALKS LIST](https://ZongruiYang1.github.io/talks/).
